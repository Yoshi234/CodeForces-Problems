# Problem Statement

Ryu, the shinagami (god of death) had allowed LightYagami, a school student, to kill as many people as he cna by using the death note. But writing the names barely will allow other people to watch them. So he encrypts the names using digits, where a means 1, b means 2, and so on upto z is 26. Now if he gives numbers, there is a communication error because a number string can be decrypted by the death note in various ways and eventually kill everyone. If everyone in the world has a unique name, for a given number, how many people can die? 

NOTE THAT:There is every possible name in the world with the 26 letters, and capital or small leters are not a problem

1. input format: 
    - a number stream denoting the first name's encrypted version
2. Output format:

3. Constraints:
    - $1 \le \text{ stream length } \le 10^{8}$
4. Sample Input: 
    - $1267$
5. Sample Output:
    - $3$
